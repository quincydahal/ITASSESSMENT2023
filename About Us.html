            <h2>Thoughtfully Sourced,
                Expertly Roasted.</h2>
            <p> 
                Back in 2003, Coast Coffee founder Quincy Dahal had a simple vision: brew high quality, delicious coffee, and serve it to the neighborhood with warm hospitality.
                We believe that exceptional coffee is not just defined by quality, but by the ability to leave a positive impact on the coffee supply stream at each step of the way. We start by forging long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with producers and trusted suppliers who share this vision, and abide by a strong set of sourcing values: quality, ethics, collaboration, and integrity.
                Our team of expert roasters roast these carefully sourced coffees in small batches, highlighting the unique qualities inherent in each coffee. We maintain rigorous QC standards at our roastery, cupping representative samples of every coffee we roast throughout the week to ensure that each cup that reaches our customers reflects the care and expertise that we put into roasting it.
                This means that farmers use methods that support three pillars of sustainability: social, economic, and environmental. Independent, third-party auditors evaluate farmers against requirements in all three areas before awarding or renewing certification.
